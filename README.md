# Arch Wiki Mirror

This repo contains an unofficial mirror of the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/). It is hosted on GitHub Pages and receives updates on a monthly basis.

Currently, this mirror is generated using the `arch-wiki-docs` package. I plan to migrate to a custom site or another static site/wiki generator using the raw wiki files in the future.

Any type of contribution is accepted. Whether it's fixing a broken link, improving the mirroring workflow file, or suggesting a new feature, your contributions are welcome.

If you find this project useful, please consider starring the repository. It gives me motivation to keep maintaining it!
